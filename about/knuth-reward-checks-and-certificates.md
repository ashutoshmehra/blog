Don Knuth has been very generously sending these [checks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check) (now certificates of deposit at [The Bank of San Serriffe](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html) as reward for my bug reports about his books. I was selected by Don to proof-read his books [Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/da.html) and [Selected Papers on Fun and Games](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fg.html) (as part of a 4-member team).
