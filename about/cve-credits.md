### Bug Bounties and CVE Credits

At one time, I was very interested in application security, especially application sandboxes. Here're some CVEs and accolades collected during that time.

Reported and credited in 18 CVEs for Windows and Internt Explorer sandbox vulnerabilities ([1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/acknowledgments/2015/acknowledgments2015), [2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/acknowledgments/2016/acknowledgments2016)).
