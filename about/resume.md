### Senior Principal Scientist, Adobe
For the past several years, I'm working on applying machine learning towards understanding the structure and semantics of documents. 

#### Liquid Mode
Most recently, I developed the ML model powering [Acrobat Liquid Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H4nRx7r7nY). 

From [Adobe blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/09/23/adobe-unveils-ambitious-multi-year-vision-for-pdf-introduces-liquid-mode.html):
> With the push of a button, Liquid Mode automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens. Powered by Adobe Sensei, Liquid Mode uses AI and machine learning in the background to understand and identify parts of a PDF, like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, tables, and more. It also attempts to understand the hierarchy and ordering of those parts to reformat a static PDF into a more dynamic and customizable experience.

#### Acrobat and Reader Sandboxes
Before that, I worked in application security, and specifcally on the design and implementation of the Adobe Reader Protected Mode sandbox. ASSET has some posts [anouncing](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/10/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-1-design.html) [and](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2010/10/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-2-the-sandbox-process.html) [describing](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2010/11/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-3-broker-process-policies-and-inter-process-communication.html) [it](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/11/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-4-the-challenge-of-sandboxing.html). Which was later integrated into Acrobat [Protected View Sandbox](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2011/06/inside-adobe-acrobat-protected-view.html).

From [ASSET](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/07/introducing-adobe-reader-protected-mode.html):
> Adobe Reader Protected Mode represents an exciting new advancement in attack mitigation. Even if an exploitable security vulnerability is found by an attacker, Adobe Reader Protected Mode will help prevent the attacker from writing files, changing registry keys or installing malware on potential victims’ computers.

* [Picked](http://blog.codechef.com/2010/01/15/january-contest-results/) [up](http://blog.codechef.com/2009/10/11/october-contest-results/) [several](http://blog.codechef.com/2009/07/15/july-algorithm-challenge-winners-test-cases-stats/) [prizes](http://blog.codechef.com/2011/02/11/february-2011-challenge-winners/) at the CodeChef competetive programming contests
* Was among the top 20 students to qualify the Indian National Physics Olympiad (InPhO) in 1999

### Programming Languages
* Recently, I've been mostly been using Python (with TensorFlow) for the ML projects
* My prior work was largely in C++ (on Windows and Mac), with heavy  x86-assembly debugging.
* I have a reasonably good understanding of the PDF format
* For jun, I enjoy programming in EMACS LISP and Haskell

### Education
B.E. (with honors) in Computer Science, [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in) (August 1999 -- June 2003). I recevied a Bronze Medal (CGPA 9.92/10) and many merit scholarships.
