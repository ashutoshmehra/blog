### Senior Principal Scientist, Adobe
I'm working on applying machine learning towards understanding the structure and semantics of documents. Most recently, I've been working on leveraging LLMs for document-related workflows.

#### Acrobat AI Assistant
These days, I'm working on the [Acrobat AI Assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAT1C5eMnlo).
From [Adobe blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/02/20/adobes-next-generative-ai-frontier-digital-documents):
> * AI Assistant: AI Assistant recommends questions based on a PDF’s content and answers questions about what's in the document — all through an intuitive conversational interface.
> * Generative summary: Get a quick understanding of the content inside long documents with short overviews in easy-to-read formats.
> * Intelligent citations: Adobe’s custom attribution engine and proprietary AI generate citations so customers can easily verify the source of AI Assistant’s answers.
> * Easy navigation: Clickable links help customers quickly find what they need in long documents so they can focus their time exploring and actioning the most important information.

Press coverage: [MIT Technology Review - Transforming document understanding and insights with generative AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/20/1088584/transforming-document-understanding-and-insights-with-generative-ai/), [The Verge - Adobe Acrobat adds generative AI to ‘easily chat with documents’](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/20/24077217/adobe-acrobat-generative-ai-assistant-chatbot-pdf-document), [Inc. - Adobe's New AI Assistant Is Designed to Read PDFs for You](https://www.inc.com/ben-sherry/adobes-new-ai-assistant-is-designed-to-read-pdfs-for-you.html), [CNBC - Adobe launches AI assistant that can search and summarize PDFs](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/20/adobe-launches-ai-assistant-that-can-search-and-summarize-pdfs.html).

#### Liquid Mode
Previously, I developed the ML model powering [Acrobat Liquid Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H4nRx7r7nY).

From [Adobe blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/09/23/adobe-unveils-ambitious-multi-year-vision-for-pdf-introduces-liquid-mode.html):
> With the push of a button, Liquid Mode automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens. Powered by Adobe Sensei, Liquid Mode uses AI and machine learning in the background to understand and identify parts of a PDF, like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, tables, and more. It also attempts to understand the hierarchy and ordering of those parts to reformat a static PDF into a more dynamic and customizable experience.

Press coverage: [The Wall Street Journal -  Adobe Freshens Up Its PDF for Mobile](https://www.wsj.com/articles/adobe-freshens-up-its-pdf-for-mobile-11600978887),  [Fortune - Adobe 2020: Change the World](https://fortune.com/company/adobe-systems/change-the-world/), [Fast Company -  Adobe finally figured out how to make PDFs make sense on a phone](https://www.fastcompany.com/90553978/adobe-finally-figured-out-how-to-make-pdfs-make-sense-on-a-phone), [CNET - Adobe peps up PDF on smartphones with AI-powered Liquid reformatting](https://www.cnet.com/news/adobe-peps-up-pdf-on-smartphones-with-ai-powered-liquid-reformatting/), [Business Insider - Adobe exec explains why the firm is using AI to transform the way people access and use documents on mobile](https://www.businessinsider.com/adobe-document-cloud-artificial-intelligence-pdf-mobile-digital-transformation-2020-9), [TechCrunch - Adobe’s ‘Liquid Mode’ uses AI to automatically redesign PDFs for mobile devices](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/adobes-liquid-mode-uses-ai-to-automatically-redesign-pdfs-for-mobile-devices/), [Axios - Adobe reinvents PDF to work better on phones](https://www.axios.com/adobe-pdf-mobile-9558385b-6939-479f-b2dc-9ad5d4d30eb0.html), [VentureBeat - Adobe’s Liquid Mode leverages AI to reformat PDFs for mobile devices](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/23/adobes-liquid-mode-leverages-ai-to-reformat-pdfs-for-mobile-devices/), [Engadget - Adobe's Liquid Mode uses AI to make PDFs easier to read on phones](https://www.engadget.com/adobe-liquid-mode-130012210.html).

TIME called [Liquid Mode as one of their Best Inventions of 2023 in the software/apps category](https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2023/6326329/adobe-liquid-mode/).

#### Acrobat and Reader Sandboxes
Before that, I worked in application security, and specifcally on the design and implementation of the Adobe Reader Protected Mode sandbox. ASSET has some posts [anouncing](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/10/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-1-design.html) [and](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2010/10/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-2-the-sandbox-process.html) [describing](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2010/11/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-3-broker-process-policies-and-inter-process-communication.html) [it](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/11/inside-adobe-reader-protected-mode-part-4-the-challenge-of-sandboxing.html). Which was later integrated into Acrobat [Protected View Sandbox](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2011/06/inside-adobe-acrobat-protected-view.html).

From [ASSET](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/07/introducing-adobe-reader-protected-mode.html):
> Adobe Reader Protected Mode represents an exciting new advancement in attack mitigation. Even if an exploitable security vulnerability is found by an attacker, Adobe Reader Protected Mode will help prevent the attacker from writing files, changing registry keys or installing malware on potential victims’ computers.
