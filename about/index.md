Iâ€™m Ashutosh, a Senior Principal Scientist at Adobe. These days, I'm working on applying machine learning towards understanding the structure and semantics of documents. Most recently, I worked on the ML model behind [Acrobat Liquid Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H4nRx7r7nY). Liquid Mode intelligently reflows PDFs (that are fixed layout documents) for smaller screens.

In a previous life, I've also worked on application security, sandboxing, and vulnerability research, and helped develop the [Acrobat Sandbox](http://blogs.adobe.com/asset/2010/07/introducing-adobe-reader-protected-mode.html).

I love to learn new things.

Here's my [resume](resume/), [here are some Don Knuth reward checks](knuth-reward-checks-and-certificates/), [here are some CVEs credited to me](cve-credits/).
